                About me
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm Leo, a Computer Science and Software Engineering student at the University
                Of Washington Bothell. I started my coding journey by learning the basics of
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which later led me to explore more advanced languages 
                like C++ and Python. My goal is to become a full stack developer with a focus on database management and engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I aim to use my creative drive and logical approach to problem solving in order to become
                a developer who writes meaningful code-solutions that not only function well but have a positive
                impact on society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even from a young age, I've been fascinated by how things are made. I would often look
                around and wonder how things were built or even how they could be improved. Today,
                I apply this same sense of curiosity and attention to detail to the porjects I build, always
                thinking about how functionality, design, and user experience can be refined.
